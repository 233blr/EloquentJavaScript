    <!-- When we looked up all the people in our data set that lived more than 90 years, only the latest generation in the data came out. Let’s take a closer look at that phenomenon.

Write a function getStatistic  that computes and returs the average age of the people in the ancestry data set per century. A person is assigned to a century by taking their year of death, dividing it by 100, and rounding it up, as in Math.ceil(person.died / 100).

function average(array) {
  function plus(a, b) { return a + b; }
  return array.reduce(plus) / array.length;
}

// Your code here.

// → 16: 43.5
//   17: 51.2
//   18: 52.8
//   19: 54.8
//   20: 84.7
//   21: 94
For bonus points, write a function groupBy that abstracts the grouping operation. It should accept as arguments an array and a function that computes the group for an element in the array and returns an object that maps group names to arrays of group members.

You have to deliver the solution files to Git repository. You can use pre-defined unit tests located in test folder in your repository (you will need to change extension to.js in order to enable them)

Ask your tutor if you have any questions. -->

        var ancestors = JSON.parse(ANCESTRY_FILE);

        function average(array) {
            function plus(a, b) { return a + b; }
            return array.reduce(plus) / array.length;
        }

        function getStatistic() {
            var group = {};
            var result = [];
            ancestors.forEach(function (element) {
                // the century the person died in
                var groupName = Math.ceil(element.died / 100);
                if (groupName in group) {
                    // if the groupName already exists in groups, push it
                    group[groupName].push(element.died - element.born);
                } else {
                    // if the groupName is not an array,
                    // create it and set it equal to element
                    group[groupName] = [element.died - element.born];
                }
            });
            // look for century and the average ages
            for (var century in group) {
                if (century) {
                    result.push(century + ': ' + average(group[century]));
