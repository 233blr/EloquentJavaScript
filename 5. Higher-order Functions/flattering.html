    <!-- Write the flatter function using the reduce method in combination with the concat method to “flatten” and return an array of arrays into a single array that has all the elements of the input arrays.

var arrays = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5], [6]];
// Your code here.
// → [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
You have to deliver the solution files to Git repository. You can use pre-defined unit tests located in test folder in your repository (you will need to change extension to.js in order to enable them)

Ask your tutor if you have any questions. -->

    <script>
        function flatter(input) {
            // applies a function to each element of the array
            var resultArr = input.reduce(function (a, b) {
                // join arrays
                return a.concat(b);
            }, []);
            return resultArr;
        }
