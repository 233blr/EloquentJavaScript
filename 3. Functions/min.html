    <!-- The previous chapter introduced the standard function Math.min that returns its smallest argument.

We can do that ourselves now.

Write a function min that takes two arguments and returns their minimum.

// Your code here.

console.log(min(0, 10));
// → 0
console.log(min(0, -10));
// → -10
You have to deliver the solution files to Git repository. You can use pre-defined unit tests located in test folder in your repository (you will need to change extension to.js in order to enable them)

Ask your tutor if you have any questions.-->

     <script>
         function min(a, b) {
    // Checking the value
    if (a < b) {
        return a;
    }
        return b;
    }
     </script>
