    <!-- You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string".charAt(N), similar to how you get its length with "s".length. The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b"). The first character has position zero, which causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1. In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.

Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters are in the string.

Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.

// Your code here.

console.log(countBs("BBC"));
// → 2
console.log(countChar("kakkerlak", "k"));
// → 4
You have to deliver the solution files to Git repository. You can use pre-defined unit tests located in test folder in your repository (you will need to change extension to.js in order to enable them)

Ask your tutor if you have any questions. -->

    <script>
        function countBs(string, val) {
            // value check
            val = (val !== undefined) ? val : 'B';
            return countChar(string, val);
        }
        function countChar(string, val) {
            var counter = 0;
            // created an array from a string and iterate over the array
            // for check for compliance with the condition
            string.split('').forEach(function (item) {

                if (item === val) {
                    counter++;
                }
            });

            return counter;
        }
