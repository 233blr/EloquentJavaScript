    <!-- 
We’ve seen that % (the remainder operator) can be used to test whether a number is even or odd by using % 2 to check whether it’s divisible by two. Here’s another way to define whether a positive whole number is even or odd:

 Zero is even.

 One is odd.

 For any other number N, its evenness is the same as N - 2.

Define a recursive function isEven corresponding to this description. The function should accept a number parameter and return a Boolean.

You have to deliver the solution files to Git repository. You can use pre-defined unit tests located in test folder in your repository (you will need to change extension to.js in order to enable them)

Ask your tutor if you have any questions.

        function isEven(val) {
            // Returns the absolute value of a number
            val = Math.abs(val);
            // Checking the number
            if (val == 0) {
                return true;
            } else if (val == 1) {
                return false;
            } else {
                return isEven(val - 2);
            }
        }
