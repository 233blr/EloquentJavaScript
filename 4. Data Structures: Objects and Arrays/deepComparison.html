  <!-- The == operator compares objects by identity. But sometimes, you would prefer to compare the values of their actual properties.

Write a function, deepEqual, that takes two values and returns true only if they are the same value or are objects with the same properties whose values are also equal when compared with a recursive call to deepEqual.

To find out whether to compare two things by identity (use the === operator for that) or by looking at their properties, you can use the typeof operator. If it produces "object" for both values, you should do a deep comparison. But you have to take one silly exception into account: by a historical accident, typeof null also produces "object".

// Your code here.

var obj = {here: {is: "an"}, object: 2};
console.log(deepEqual(obj, obj));
// → true
console.log(deepEqual(obj, {here: 1, object: 2}));
// → false
console.log(deepEqual(obj, {here: {is: "an"}, object: 2}));
// → true
You have to deliver the solution files to Git repository. You can use pre-defined unit tests located in test folder in your repository (you will need to change extension to.js in order to enable them)

Ask your tutor if you have any questions.-->
